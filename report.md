With this lab I did the following: 

I logged into my GitHub and created a repository named 2713865-SD1 which I made public. Thereafter I created and committed my three necessary files with their respective content (the txt file with the commit message "feat: Initial commit with student files"). Additionally I created the branch  feature/student-details. Then I edited my HTML file to include a descriptive heading and committed that as well with an appropriate commit message. Lastly I edited and am committing this very file. Then to be deployed and put in a bundle.

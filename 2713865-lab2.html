            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Before I embarrassingly fall into the common trap of writing
                 a mediocre paragraph about myself, let me ensure that I first highlight the utmost ecstatic details and highlights
                 about my exciting life: My name is Zayd Fazel-Ellahi and I was born on the 11th of February 2004. </p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project involved decrypting a passage in a 
                book i recently read. The text was a passage full of the digits 0-9, which in the text,
                translates to letters of the English alphabet. Exactly like how we sent messages on older phones.
            I wrote code to decrypt this message; translating it into sentences that the character was trying to say.
